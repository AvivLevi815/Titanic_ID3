# Titanic_ID3
My ID3 implementation of the famous titanic challenge on kaggle.com (77.9%)

So this is not the way a normal Kaggle challenge should be addressed by because I implemented the ID3 algorithm on my own.
This is not your usual git project either,
I first submitted the challenge and only after that I learned git.

Naturally, this git repo has a VERY small number of commits, but it was motivational important for me to put this here to mark 2 goals reached:
1. learning python.
2. Make a Kaggle submission
3. learn how to use Git and Github.
